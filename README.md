# Express.js Server Missing Response Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the server starts without errors but fails to respond to client requests.  The issue stems from a missing `res.send()` or similar method within a route handler.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that listens on port 3000.  The `/` route handler logs a message to the console when a request is received but does not send any response back to the client.  This results in the client's request hanging indefinitely.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server.  The `/` route handler now includes `res.send('Hello from Express!')` to send a response to the client, resolving the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the buggy server.
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.  You will observe that the request hangs.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the corrected server. 
6. Access `http://localhost:3000` again. This time, you should see the 'Hello from Express!' message.

## Lessons Learned

Always remember to send an appropriate response using methods like `res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.sendFile()`, etc. within your Express.js route handlers.  Failure to do so will lead to unresponsive servers and frustrated users.
